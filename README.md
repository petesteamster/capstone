  The r scripts are 1) actual_ampute.R and  2) compare_imputes.R.
  
  # 1 performs the amputes for python and R. #2 does a absolute sum comparision
  
  The code in python_code cannot be run fully from to bottom. The first section is run to create
  imput for the script actual_ampute.R.  
  
  The file python_2_code contains additional work. It shows that the R imputation performs better
  than the Python version when the distribution of the imputed data is accounted for.
