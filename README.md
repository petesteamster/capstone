## The Problem of Missing Data 
Below is a partial data set used to predict sales at a hardware store for a month. The features are ***Rain (1=yes,0=no),Cloudy (1=yes,0=no),Temperature,Customers in a 24 hour period***. The features are used in an attempt to see how weather affects sales. Note that some of the data is flagged as missing. A predictive model cannot be built if we do not fill in the missing data with values. Also, because collecting data takes time and money, we dont want to toss the data out. What values should we use to fill in the missing data?
